codename: xSoko is a classic sokoban remake in 3D with innovative add-ons, such as:

  * obstacle destroying in BOMBERMAN style
  * teleports
  * bridges
  * cubes that you can push in only one way
  * ... and some more

xSoko is still under development and it is cross-platform.

xSoko2embedded is port of xSoko game engine and game itself to ARM platform and is being ported by exchange student(and co-author of xSoko) at School of Technology, Seinajoki University of Applied Sciences, Finland.

Currently it (officially) supports Windows Mobile 6.0, PocketPC 2003 and Smartphone 2003 platforms. In future, port for Android, Symbian, iPhone and others mobile platforms will also be provided.

If someone would like to help, for example, make a level for this game, textures or something else, contact me. You can download a level editor on <a href='http://code.google.com/p/xsoko'>xSoko page</a> under "Download" section(xSoko and xSoko2embedded level formats are compatible) and make your very own level!
